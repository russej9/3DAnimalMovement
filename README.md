# 3DAnimalMovement

This project is used to Visualize animal movement in 3D using Unity.

It was created for researchers at The Ohio State University and The Max Planck Institute.

# How To Use

Once you have downloaded the project and are able to open it in Unity. Take dataset and run DataConverter.py found in the Data folder of the project. From there the application can be run and open the dataset in the application.

Build is found in the Build folder so user does not need to have Unity to run the application

Use arrow keys to move camera
Right click and drag to change camera angle
Scroll to zoom in and out

Recommended to use the AnimalTest.csv data set if you are testing the application because it is smaller and will therefore load quicker, especially if you are using a lower end computer
